The fine people at Slate Magazine, my former employer, have given me permission to open-source Text Toggle (a.k.a. Plain English), a script that lets readers toggle between two versions of a text. (At Slate, we used it to [translate Fed statements into "plain English"](http://labs.slate.com/articles/plain-english/).) I'm rewriting it from the ground up. In the meantime, don't hesitate to chime in with any suggestions.
